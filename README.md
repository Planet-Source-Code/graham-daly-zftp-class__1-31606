## zFTP Class


</div>

### Description

This is a comprehensive FTP class which relies solely on API calls to the wininet dll. The winsock control is not required.

It is reasonably easy to understand and is quite robust, with plenty of error handling throughout.

Also, ample examples have been provided in the accompanying readme file.

Many thanks to Randy Birch's wesite, where much of the functionality was absorbed from.
